# Coupled-Oscillator-
Simulation and analysis of coupled oscillators, focusing on dynamical behavior, normal modes, and energy exchange using mathematical modeling and numerical methods.
# Coupled Oscillator

This repository is dedicated to the study and simulation of **coupled oscillators**, a fundamental concept in physics and engineering with applications in classical mechanics, electronics, optics, and complex dynamical systems.

## Overview
Coupled oscillators consist of two or more oscillatory systems interacting through a coupling mechanism. This interaction leads to phenomena such as **normal modes**, **frequency splitting**, and **energy transfer** between oscillators.
